# Data_EDA_-_Preprocessing
Config files for my GitHub profile.

This is FIRST STEP in Data Analysis with python. do preparation for machine learning.

In this Repository my intention is practicing pandas, matplotlim, seaborn libraries. So this repository is for those who just begin their data analysis Learning Journey.

Significance of EDA
1. EDA helps to understand the data better
2. It helps to obtain confidence in data to a point where ready to engage a machine learning algorithms.
3. It allows to refine selection of feature variables that will be used later for model.
4. Development and representation of the results
